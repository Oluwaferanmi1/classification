# Classification
This project implements a deep learning model that differentiates between images of cats and dogs. The model is designed to classify an image as either a cat or a dog based on the features learned from the training dataset.
Features:
Binary Image Classification: The model predicts whether an image is a cat or a dog.
Dataset: The accuracy of the model improves with the size and diversity of the training dataset. More images allow the model to better generalize and correctly classify new images.
Deep Learning Architecture: Uses a neural network (e.g., CNN) for image classification, leveraging image features to distinguish between cats and dogs.
Project Structure:
cat_vs_dog_model.ipynb: The main code for building, training, and evaluating the classification model.
datasets/: Directory for storing training and testing datasets of cat and dog images.
models/: Directory for saving trained models and weights.
How It Works:
The model is trained on a labeled dataset of cat and dog images.
The more images the model is trained on, the better it performs. You can improve the accuracy by feeding the model a larger and more varied dataset.
The final output is a binary classification: either Cat or Dog.
Accuracy:
The accuracy of the model increases as more images are used during the training phase.
Experiment with different dataset sizes, learning rates, and architectures to improve the model's performance.
